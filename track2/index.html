   <div class="scroll-up one">The olive tree does not weep and does not laugh. The olive tree</br>
    Is the hillside’s modest lady. Shadow</br>
    Covers her one leg, and she will not take her leaves off in front of the storm.
    </div>
    <div class="scroll-up two">Standing, she is seated, and seated, standing.</div>
    <div class="scroll-up one">She lives as a friendly sister of eternity, neighbor of time</br>
      That helps her stock her luminous oil and</br>
      Forget the invaders’ names, except the Romans, who</br>
      Coexisted with her, and borrowed some of her branches</br>
      To weave wreaths. They did not treat her as a prisoner of war</br>
      But as a venerable grandmother, before whose calm dignity</br>
      Swords shatter. In her reticent silver-green</br>
      Color hesitates to say what it thinks, and to look at what is behind</br>
      The portrait, for the olive tree is neither green nor silver.</br>
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-up two">The olive tree is the color of peace, if peace needed</br>
        A color. No one says to the olive tree: How beautiful you are!
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-up one">But: How noble and how splendid! And she,</br>
        She who teaches soldiers to lay down their rifles</br>
        And re-educates them in tenderness and humility: Go home</br>
        And light your lamps with my oil! But</br>
        These soldiers, these modern soldiers</br>
        Besiege her with bulldozers and uproot her from her lineage</br>
        Of earth. They vanquished our grandmother who foundered,</br>
        Her branches on the ground, her roots in the sky.
      </div>
      <div class="scroll-up two">She did not weep or cry out.  But one of her grandsons</br>
        Who witnessed the execution threw a stone</br>
        At a soldier, and he was martyred with her.
       </div>
       <div class="scroll-up one"> After the victorious soldiers</br>
        Had gone on their way, we buried him there, in that deep</br>
        Pit – the grandmother’s cradle. And that is why we were</br>
        Sure that he would become, in a little while, an olive</br>
        Tree – a thorny olive tree – and green!</div>
